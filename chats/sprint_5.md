koshkidadanet: I manually updated the "about_me" value for a user, ran the script `data_science.py`, but the user's embeddings didn't change. Why did this happen, and how can it be fixed?

GitHub Copilot: Let me analyze the issue and propose a solution.

Problem: When you manually update a user's "about_me" value in the database, the vector store synchronization in `data_science.py` doesn't detect this change because the `sync_with_database()` method only checks for the existence of vectors, not for changes in the underlying text data.

Here's how to fix this:

### [data_science.py](file:///home/koshkidadanet/My%20Files/connect-bot/src/data_science.py)

Add a method to detect content changes and modify the sync logic:



This solution adds a new method `_content_changed()` that checks if a user's content has changed by:
1. Retrieving current vector embeddings from ChromaDB
2. Generating new embeddings from current user text
3. Comparing the embeddings to detect changes

The `sync_with_database()` method now checks for content changes in addition to checking for vector existence.

To fix your current issue:
1. Run the script with these changes
2. It will detect the content change and update the embeddings automatically
3. The new embeddings will reflect the updated "about_me" text

If you want to force an immediate update for a specific user, you can also manually call:


Made changes.

# –î–æ—Ä–∞–±–æ—Ç–∫–∏ –ø–µ—Ä–µ–¥ —Ä–µ–∞–ª–∏–∑–∞—Ü–∏–µ–π –Ω–æ—Ç–∏—Ñ–∏–∫–∞—Ü–∏–π

koshkidadanet: Currently, the user profile ranking is only updated when the user's profile is updated. In this case, the method `vector_store.update_user_rankings(user)` is called. I want the user profile ranking to be updated every time the user selects the action "1. –°–º–æ—Ç—Ä–µ—Ç—å –∞–Ω–∫–µ—Ç—ã"

As a result, the logic that updates the ranking when the user's profile is changed should be removed, and this logic should be added to the "1. –°–º–æ—Ç—Ä–µ—Ç—å –∞–Ω–∫–µ—Ç—ã" action instead.

GitHub Copilot: I'll help modify the code to update rankings when viewing profiles instead of when updating the user's profile.

### [aiogram_bot.py](file:///home/koshkidadanet/My%20Files/connect-bot/src/aiogram_bot.py)

Remove ranking update from profile updates and add it to the profile viewing action.



The main changes are:
1. Removed `vector_store.handle_user_update(user)` calls when updating the user's profile
2. Removed the `needs_ranking_update` flag as it's no longer needed
3. Added `vector_store.update_user_rankings(user)` to always run when the user starts viewing profiles
4. Reset the profile index to -1 when starting to view profiles, since rankings are always fresh

This ensures that rankings are always up-to-date when a user starts viewing profiles, rather than only updating when profiles change.

Made changes.

koshkidadanet: During bot testing, it was discovered that when a new user creates a profile, it is not visible to other users. It only becomes visible after restarting the bot. Why does this happen, and how can this issue be resolved?

GitHub Copilot: Let me analyze the issue and propose a solution.

Problem Analysis:
1. The issue occurs because the vector store is not being updated when new users create profiles
2. The synchronization between the database and vector store only happens at bot startup
3. While we handle vector store updates for profile changes, we're not properly handling new profile creation

Solution Steps:
1. Add vector store updates when a new user profile is created
2. This should happen after the user completes their profile with media files
3. We need to modify the media handling code where the profile completion occurs

### [aiogram_bot.py](file:///home/koshkidadanet/My%20Files/connect-bot/src/aiogram_bot.py)

Add vector store updates when new profiles are created:



The changes:
1. Added `vector_store.update_user_vectors(user)` when a profile is completed via "–ú–æ—è –∞–Ω–∫–µ—Ç–∞" button
2. Added `vector_store.update_user_vectors(user)` when media upload is completed
3. Note: There was no need to modify `handle_media_upload` since it returns a boolean indicating completion

This solution ensures that:
1. New profiles are immediately added to the vector store
2. Other users can see new profiles without bot restart
3. The vector store stays synchronized with the database in real-time

The issue should now be resolved, and new profiles will be immediately visible to other users.

Made changes.

koshkidadanet: Alright, now when a new user creates their profile, it becomes visible to other users. However, when a user edits their profile, it disappears from view. Fix this.

GitHub Copilot: I see the issue. When a user edits their profile, we need to make it visible again by updating the vector store after the profile is modified. Here's the solution:

### [aiogram_bot.py](file:///home/koshkidadanet/My%20Files/connect-bot/src/aiogram_bot.py)

The issue is in two places:
1. When keeping current media in profile edit
2. When completing profile edit with new media



The changes:
1. Added `vector_store.update_user_vectors(user)` when keeping current media
2. Added both `vector_store.update_user_vectors(user)` and `vector_store.update_user_rankings(user)` when completing profile with new media

This ensures that:
1. The profile is added to the vector store after editing
2. Rankings are updated for the edited profile
3. The profile becomes visible to other users immediately after editing

These changes should fix the issue of profiles disappearing after editing.

Made changes.

koshkidadanet: Now I want the usernames of Telegram users to be visible when viewing profiles. Currently, usernames are not stored in the tables, so I think they need to be added to implement my idea.

As a result, `rank_text` needs to be updated so that it displays the username:  
`rank_text = f"/{rank}" if rank is not None else ""`

GitHub Copilot: Let's solve this step by step:

1. First, we need to modify the database model to store usernames
2. Then update the profile creation/editing logic to save usernames
3. Finally, update the profile display to show usernames

### [models.py](file:///home/koshkidadanet/My%20Files/connect-bot/src/models.py)

Add username field to TelegramUser model:



### [aiogram_bot.py](file:///home/koshkidadadanet/My%20Files/connect-bot/src/aiogram_bot.py)

Update profile creation and display logic:



### [main.py](file:///home/koshkidadanet/My%20Files/connect-bot/src/main.py)

Add migration to update existing tables:



The changes:
1. Added `username` column to TelegramUser model
2. Updated user creation to store username from message.from_user
3. Modified profile display to show username in rank_text
4. Added migration option to update existing tables

To apply these changes:
1. Stop the bot
2. Run main.py to update the database schema
3. Restart the bot

Now usernames will be stored and displayed when viewing profiles. Users without usernames will still show just the rank number.

Made changes.

# –ü—Ä–æ–º–ø—Ç —Å –∫–æ—Ç–æ—Ä—ã–º –º–æ–¥–µ–ª–∏ –Ω–µ —Å–ø—Ä–∞–≤–∏–ª–∏—Å—å

**Task:**  
Currently, users can browse profiles by clicking the "–î–∞–ª–µ–µ" button. It is required to implement the ability to like another user's profile and notify users about received likes. Users who are liked should have the option to give a mutual like.  

**Requirements:**  
1. When browsing profiles, the "–î–∞–ª–µ–µ" button should be replaced with two buttons: "‚ù§Ô∏è" and "üëé".  
   - The heart button ("‚ù§Ô∏è") is used to like a profile.  
   - The thumbs-down button ("üëé") performs the functionality of the previous "–î–∞–ª–µ–µ" button, allowing the user to skip to the next profile.  

2. If a user receives a like or a mutual like, they should get a notification with the message:  
   - *"–£—Ä–∞, —Ç—ã –∫–æ–º—É-—Ç–æ –ø–æ–Ω—Ä–∞–≤–∏–ª—Å—è. –ö–æ–ª–∏—á–µ—Å—Ç–≤–æ –ª–∞–π–∫–æ–≤ - n. –ü–æ–∫–∞–∑–∞—Ç—å, –∫—Ç–æ —ç—Ç–æ?"*  
   A "–ü–æ–∫–∞–∑–∞—Ç—å" button should appear when a notification is received. Upon clicking "–ü–æ–∫–∞–∑–∞—Ç—å" the user can browse the profiles of people who liked them.  
   - `n` represents the total number of likes and mutual likes the user has received.  

3. When a user browses the profiles of those who liked them:  
   - **For regular likes:**  
     - Display the buttons "‚ù§Ô∏è" and "üëé".  
     - If the user clicks "üëé," the profile is skipped, and the next one is shown.  
     - If the user clicks "‚ù§Ô∏è," a message should appear:  
       *"–û—Ç–ª–∏—á–Ω–æ! –ù–∞–¥–µ—é—Å—å —Ö–æ—Ä–æ—à–æ –ø—Ä–æ–≤–µ–¥–µ—Ç–µ –≤—Ä–µ–º—è ;) –ù–∞—á–∏–Ω–∞–π –æ–±—â–∞—Ç—å—Å—è —Å üëâ [telegram profile link]."*  

   - **For mutual likes:**  
     - Immediately display the message:  
       *"–≠—Ç–æ –≤–∑–∞–∏–º–Ω–∞—è —Å–∏–º–ø–∞—Ç–∏—è! –ù–∞–¥–µ—é—Å—å —Ö–æ—Ä–æ—à–æ –ø—Ä–æ–≤–µ–¥–µ—Ç–µ –≤—Ä–µ–º—è ;) –ù–∞—á–∏–Ω–∞–π –æ–±—â–∞—Ç—å—Å—è —Å üëâ [telegram profile link]."*  
     
   Include a "–î–∞–ª–µ–µ" button. Clicking "–î–∞–ª–µ–µ" will allow the user to continue browsing the profiles of people who liked them.  

4. In points 2 and 3, I am referring to [telegram profile link]. The link to the user's profile should be displayed as the username they set during registration, i.e., the `name` field in the `telegram_users` table. The link itself should be generated based on the `telegram_id` or `username` fields.

5. After the user has browsed all the profiles of people who liked them, show the message:  
   - *"–ù–∞ —ç—Ç–æ–º –ø–æ–∫–∞ –≤—Å–µ! 1. –°–º–æ—Ç—Ä–µ—Ç—å –¥—Ä—É–≥–∏–µ –∞–Ω–∫–µ—Ç—ã. 2. –ú–æ—è –∞–Ω–∫–µ—Ç–∞"*  
   Below the message, display buttons "1" and "2":  
   - Clicking "1" takes the user back to browsing other profiles.  
   - Clicking "2" takes the user to their profile (functionality of the `/profile` command).  

6. When implementing, use the `likes` table; you may modify it if necessary.

# –ù–æ—Ç–∏—Ñ–∏–∫–∞—Ü–∏–∏ –æ –ª–∞–π–∫–∞—Ö —á–∞—Å—Ç—å 1

koshkidadanet: Let's add a likes table to the schema with the fields id, from_user_id, to_user_id, is_mutual, and viewed. This table is needed to enable liking other users' profiles.

GitHub Copilot: I'll help you modify the schema to add the likes functionality. We need to modify the models and add the new relationship.

### [models.py](file:///home/koshkidadanet/My%20Files/connect-bot/src/models.py)

Add the Likes table and relationships to TelegramUser model.



This change:
1. Adds a new Likes table with the requested fields
2. Establishes bidirectional relationships between TelegramUser and Likes
3. Uses CASCADE deletion to automatically remove likes when users are deleted
4. Adds Boolean fields for tracking mutual likes and viewed status
5. Implements proper foreign key relationships with the users table

The changes are minimal and focused. The existing functionality will continue to work as before, and the new table will be created when the database schema is next updated through FastAPI's initialization process.

Made changes.

koshkidadanet: Currently, when a user views profiles of other users, they use the "–î–∞–ª–µ–µ" button to display the next profile. It is required to add a "–õ–∞–π–∫" button, which will also display the next profile while adding a record to the `likes` table.

Fields of the `likes` table:
- `id`: a simple record identifier
- `from_user_id`: the `id` of the user who gave the like
- `to_user_id`: the `id` of the user who received the like
- `is_mutual`: a flag indicating whether the like is mutual. For now, set it to 0 or False
- `viewed`: a flag indicating whether the recipient has seen the like. For now, set it to 0 or False

GitHub Copilot: Let's implement the like functionality. Here's what we need to do:

1. Modify the keyboard layout to include both "–õ–∞–π–∫" and "–î–∞–ª–µ–µ" buttons
2. Add a new handler for the "–õ–∞–π–∫" button
3. Create a function to handle like creation
4. Update the profile viewing flow

### [aiogram_bot.py](file:///home/koshkidadanet/My%20Files/connect-bot/src/aiogram_bot.py)

Update keyboard layout and add like functionality.



The changes:

1. Modified `get_next_profile_keyboard()` to include both "–õ–∞–π–∫" and "–î–∞–ª–µ–µ" buttons
2. Added `create_like()` function to handle like creation
3. Added `handle_like_profile()` handler for the "–õ–∞–π–∫" button that:
   - Creates a like record
   - Shows the next profile automatically

The rest of the code remains unchanged. The "–î–∞–ª–µ–µ" button will continue to work as before, just skipping profiles without creating likes.

When users click "–õ–∞–π–∫", it will:
1. Create a record in the likes table
2. Set is_mutual and viewed to False
3. Automatically show the next profile

This implementation maintains the existing flow while adding the like functionality seamlessly.

Made changes.

koshkidadanet: Great. Now let's make it so that the user sees the message "–í—ã —É–∂–µ –ø–æ—Å—Ç–∞–≤–∏–ª–∏ –ª–∞–π–∫ —ç—Ç–æ–π –∞–Ω–∫–µ—Ç–µ. –ñ–¥–∏—Ç–µ –æ—Ç–≤–µ—Ç–∞!" when they try to like a profile they've already liked.  
After that, the next profile should still be displayed as usual.

GitHub Copilot: I'll help add this functionality. We need to:
1. Check if the user has already liked the profile before creating a new like
2. Add a new message to the MESSAGES dictionary
3. Modify the handle_like_profile function to handle this case

### [aiogram_bot.py](file:///home/koshkidadanet/My%20Files/connect-bot/src/aiogram_bot.py)

Add a new message and modify the like handling logic:



The changes:
1. Added 'already_liked' message to MESSAGES dictionary
2. Modified create_like function to check for existing likes and return a boolean
3. Updated handle_like_profile to show the "already liked" message when appropriate
4. Kept the "show next profile" functionality regardless of whether the like was new or duplicate

The rest of the code remains unchanged. The system will now inform users when they try to like a profile they've already liked, while maintaining the smooth profile browsing experience.

Made changes.

koshkidadanet: Let's replace the button text "Like" and "Next" with "‚ù§Ô∏è" and "üëé".

GitHub Copilot: I'll help modify the button text. We need to change the keyboard layout function.

### [aiogram_bot.py](file:///home/koshkidadanet/My%20Files/connect-bot/src/aiogram_bot.py)

Update the next profile keyboard function and associated handlers:



This change:
1. Updates the keyboard layout to use emoji buttons "‚ù§Ô∏è" and "üëé"
2. Updates the handlers to match the new button text
3. The rest of the functionality remains exactly the same

The changes are minimal but make the interface more visually appealing and intuitive.

Made changes.

koshkidadanet: Now, when a user likes another user's profile, the recipient should receive a message:  
*"–£—Ä–∞, —Ç—ã –∫–æ–º—É-—Ç–æ –ø–æ–Ω—Ä–∞–≤–∏–ª—Å—è. –ö–æ–ª–∏—á–µ—Å—Ç–≤–æ –ª–∞–π–∫–æ–≤ - n. –ü–æ–∫–∞–∑–∞—Ç—å, –∫—Ç–æ —ç—Ç–æ?"*  
Here, `n` is the number of users who have liked their profile. Upon receiving this message, a "–ü–æ–∫–∞–∑–∞—Ç—å" button should appear. When the user clicks this button, they can view the profiles of those who liked them. Additionally, let's add a "–î–∞–ª–µ–µ" button to allow scrolling through these profiles.  

After the user has viewed all the profiles of people who liked them, display the message:  
"""–ù–∞ —ç—Ç–æ–º –ø–æ–∫–∞ –≤—Å–µ! 
1. –°–º–æ—Ç—Ä–µ—Ç—å –¥—Ä—É–≥–∏–µ –∞–Ω–∫–µ—Ç—ã.
2. –ú–æ—è –∞–Ω–∫–µ—Ç–∞"""  
- Clicking "1" returns the user to browsing other profiles.  
- Clicking "2" takes the user to their own profile (equivalent to the functionality of the `/profile` command).  

GitHub Copilot: I'll help implement this functionality. Here's the step-by-step solution:

1. Add new states for viewing likes
2. Add new message templates and keyboard functions
3. Add functionality to notify users about new likes
4. Add handlers for viewing likes

### [aiogram_bot.py](file:///home/koshkidadanet/My%20Files/connect-bot/src/aiogram_bot.py)



The changes include:

1. Added new `viewing_likes` state
2. Added new messages for like notifications and viewing
3. Added new keyboard layouts for like-related actions
4. Added functions for:
   - Notifying users about new likes
   - Getting unviewed likes
   - Viewing likes one by one
5. Modified the like creation process to notify users
6. Added handlers for:
   - Starting to view likes
   - Navigating through likes
   - Handling after-likes actions

When someone likes a profile:
1. The recipient gets notified with a count of unviewed likes
2. They can click "–ü–æ–∫–∞–∑–∞—Ç—å" to view the profiles
3. They can navigate through profiles using "üëé"
4. After viewing all likes, they can choose to view more profiles or see their own profile

The system keeps track of viewed/unviewed likes and updates the status accordingly.

Made changes.

koshkidadanet: After viewing the profiles that liked the user, they see the message `no_more_likes`. Let's change it to "–ù–∞ —ç—Ç–æ–º –ø–æ–∫–∞ –≤—Å–µ! –í—ã –º–æ–∂–µ—Ç–µ –ø–æ—Å–º–æ—Ç—Ä–µ—Ç—å –∞–Ω–∫–µ—Ç—ã –¥—Ä—É–≥–∏—Ö –ø–æ–ª—å–∑–æ–≤–∞—Ç–µ–ª–µ–π." and display a button labeled "–°–º–æ—Ç—Ä–µ—Ç—å –∞–Ω–∫–µ—Ç—ã" which will trigger `start_viewing_profiles`.

GitHub Copilot: I'll help you modify the message and button functionality. We need to update the message text and keyboard handling.

### [aiogram_bot.py](file:///home/koshkidadanet/My%20Files/connect-bot/src/aiogram_bot.py)



The changes:
1. Updated the 'no_more_likes' message text
2. Added a new keyboard function `get_view_profiles_keyboard()`
3. Modified `view_next_like()` to use the new keyboard
4. Added a new handler for the "–°–º–æ—Ç—Ä–µ—Ç—å –∞–Ω–∫–µ—Ç—ã" button

When users finish viewing their likes, they'll see the new message with a single button that lets them start viewing other profiles.

Made changes.

koshkidadanet: During testing of the new functionality for viewing user profiles of those who liked, several errors were identified:  

1. When clicking "‚ù§Ô∏è", nothing happens. Let's make it so that in the `likes` table, the `is_mutual` field is set to `true`, and the next profile is displayed, or the message `no_more_likes` is shown. Let's not create a new entry in the likes table.
2. When clicking "üëé", everything works as expected, but I see an error:


GitHub Copilot: Let's fix both issues. Here are the needed changes:

### [aiogram_bot.py](file:///home/koshkidadanet/My%20Files/connect-bot/src/aiogram_bot.py)



The changes:
1. Added new handler `handle_like_in_likes_view` for handling likes while viewing received likes
2. Fixed the error by replacing `state.finish()` with `state.clear()` as the correct method
3. Added mutual like functionality by updating `is_mutual` field when liking back
4. Kept the flow of showing next profile or ending the viewing session

When a user clicks ‚ù§Ô∏è while viewing profiles that liked them:
1. The current like's `is_mutual` field is set to `true`
2. The next profile is shown (or the viewing session ends if there are no more profiles)

When clicking üëé, the error is now fixed by using the correct method `clear()` instead of `finish()`.

Made changes.

koshkidadanet: Now, when the user clicks on '‚ù§Ô∏è' while viewing the profiles of users who liked them, the following message should appear:  
*'Great! Hope you have a good time ;) Start chatting with üëâ [telegram profile link].'*

[telegram profile link] - The link to the user's profile should be displayed as the username they set during registration, i.e., the `name` field in the `telegram_users` table. The link itself should be generated based on the `telegram_id` or `username` fields.

After this message, the next profile should appear or the message `no_more_likes` should be displayed."

GitHub Copilot: I'll help add this functionality. We need to:
1. Add a new message template
2. Modify the like handler to show the profile link
3. Update the profile display flow

### [aiogram_bot.py](file:///home/koshkidadanet/My%20Files/connect-bot/src/aiogram_bot.py)



The changes:

1. Added new message template 'mutual_like'
2. Added `get_user_profile_link` helper function that:
   - Returns `@username` if username is set
   - Returns `tg://user?id={id}` link otherwise
3. Updated `handle_like_in_likes_view` to:
   - Show the mutual like message with profile link
   - Then continue with normal flow

Now when a user likes back a profile, they'll see the new message with a clickable link to the user's profile, followed by either the next profile or the "no more likes" message.

Made changes.

koshkidadanet: In `get_user_profile_link`, you're creating a regular link, but it should display as the username the user set during registration. In other words, the profile link should be masked with the `name` field from the `telegram_users` table.

Also, the link in the format `f"tg://user?id={user.telegram_id}"` doesn't work. I searched for solutions to this issue and came across the following response:


GitHub Copilot: I'll help modify the code to properly format the Telegram user links and use them correctly with HTML parsing.

### [aiogram_bot.py](file:///home/koshkidadanet/My%20Files/connect-bot/src/aiogram_bot.py)



The changes:
1. Modified `get_user_profile_link` to:
   - Use HTML format for links
   - Display the user's name (from registration) as the link text
   - Use https://t.me/ format for username links
2. Updated the mutual like handler to use HTML parse mode
3. Links will now show the user's registered name while linking to their Telegram profile

Now when users get a mutual match, they'll see a message with a nicely formatted link showing the other person's name from their registration, which links to their Telegram profile.

Made changes.

koshkidadanet: Great. Now we need to remove the preview of the user profile link so that the bot sends the link as plain text only.

GitHub Copilot: We need to modify the `get_user_profile_link` function to add `disable_web_page_preview=True` parameter to the message. Here's how to do it:

### [aiogram_bot.py](file:///home/koshkidadanet/My%20Files/connect-bot/src/aiogram_bot.py)



The change adds the `disable_web_page_preview=True` parameter to the `message.answer()` call when sending the mutual like message. This will prevent Telegram from generating a preview for the user's profile link while still maintaining the link functionality.

Made changes.

koshkidadanet: In the `view_next_like` method, I added logging using `print`. A situation is simulated where the user receives 3 likes and likes all profiles in return.  

The first two profiles are displayed correctly, but the third one is not shown. Instead, the second profile is displayed again.  

The issue is clearly visible in the logs. `like.from_user_id` is equal to 16 twice.   
Pay attention that in the `mutual_like` message, there should be a link to the profile of the user who was just liked.  
Think carefully and fix this problem.


GitHub Copilot: I see the issue. The problem is that we're using `unviewed_likes = await get_unviewed_likes(db, viewer.id)` multiple times, and between calls, we're marking likes as viewed. Let's fix this by getting the likes once and storing them in state data.

### [aiogram_bot.py](file:///home/koshkidadanet/My%20Files/connect-bot/src/aiogram_bot.py)



The changes:

1. Store like IDs in state data when starting to view likes
2. Use these stored IDs to fetch specific likes instead of querying for unviewed likes repeatedly
3. Mark all likes as viewed only at the end
4. Get correct like by ID when showing profile or handling mutual like

This should fix the issue by:
- Maintaining a consistent list of likes throughout the viewing session
- Preventing any race conditions or state changes between views
- Ensuring each like is processed exactly once

Now each profile should be shown exactly once, and the mutual like message will always reference the correct user.

Made changes.


# –ù–æ—Ç–∏—Ñ–∏–∫–∞—Ü–∏–∏ –æ –ª–∞–π–∫–∞—Ö —á–∞—Å—Ç—å 2

koshkidadanet: Currently, in `handle_like_in_likes_view`, when a user gives a mutual like, we update the `is_mutual` field in the `likes` table to `true`. In addition to this, let's also add a new record about the like in the table and notify the recipient of the like by sending them a `new_like` message.

GitHub Copilot: I'll help modify the `handle_like_in_likes_view` function to add reciprocal like record and notification. Here's the solution:

### [aiogram_bot.py](file:///home/koshkidadanet/My%20Files/connect-bot/src/aiogram_bot.py)

Add reciprocal like creation and notification to the mutual like handler.



The changes:
1. Added creation of a reciprocal like record with `is_mutual=True`
2. Added a count of unviewed likes for the other user
3. Added notification to the other user about receiving a new like using the existing `notify_about_like` function

When a user gives a mutual like, both users will have a like record in the database marked as mutual, and both will be notified appropriately.

Made changes.

koshkidadanet: In `handle_like_in_likes_view` let's add a new entry to the `likes` table and notify the user only if an entry with the same `from_user_id` and `to_user_id` has not already been added to the table. I want to implement this to avoid creating duplicate likes.

GitHub Copilot: Here's how we can modify `handle_like_in_likes_view` to prevent duplicate likes by using the existing `create_like` function which already handles this logic.

### [aiogram_bot.py](file:///home/koshkidadanet/My%20Files/connect-bot/src/aiogram_bot.py)

Modify handle_like_in_likes_view to use create_like function for duplicate checking.



Key changes made:
1. Removed manual creation of reciprocal like record
2. Now using the existing `create_like` function which already has duplicate checking
3. Only showing the mutual like message if the like was successfully created
4. Notification is now handled by the `create_like` function
5. Commit the mutual status update separately since create_like has its own transaction

This change ensures we don't create duplicate likes while maintaining all the existing functionality. The `create_like` function already handles checking for duplicates, creating the like record, and sending notifications.

Made changes.

koshkidadanet: When User 1 likes User 2, and User 2 responds with a like in return, User 1 receives a `new_like` notification. When User 2 scrolls through received likes and encounters User 1's profile, pressing the "‚ù§Ô∏é" button does nothing. I want a `mutual_like` message to be displayed instead.

GitHub Copilot: This issue occurs because we need to properly handle mutual likes when they already exist. Let's modify the relevant code in `handle_like_in_likes_view` function to properly check and handle mutual likes.

### [aiogram_bot.py](file:///home/koshkidadanet/My%20Files/connect-bot/src/aiogram_bot.py)

Modify the `handle_like_in_likes_view` function to check for existing mutual likes.



Key changes:
1. Added a check for existing mutual like before creating a new one
2. If there's already a mutual like (in either direction), just show the mutual like message
3. Only create new reciprocal like and send notifications if it's a new mutual match
4. Removed the use of `create_like` function since we need more specific control over mutual status

This change will ensure that:
1. When User 2 views User 1's like and clicks ‚ù§Ô∏è, if there's already a mutual like, they'll just see the mutual like message
2. No duplicate like entries will be created
3. Notifications are only sent for new mutual likes

Made changes.

koshkidadanet: Great, in such cases, can we display only the "‚ù§Ô∏é" button and remove the "üëé" button? This will simplify the interface since we know the like is mutual, and there's no point in showing the "üëé" button.

GitHub Copilot: Yes, I see we already have the `get_next_mutual_like_keyboard()` function defined but we need to properly use it in the `view_next_like` function. Here's how to modify the code:

### [aiogram_bot.py](file:///home/koshkidadanet/My%20Files/connect-bot/src/aiogram_bot.py)

Update the `view_next_like` function to use different keyboards based on mutual status.



Key changes:
1. Added check for existing mutual like before showing the profile
2. Use `get_next_mutual_like_keyboard()` when either the current like is mutual or there's an existing mutual like
3. Otherwise, use the standard `get_next_profile_keyboard()`
4. Simplified the media sending logic for better readability

This change ensures that when a user is viewing a profile that already has a mutual like, they'll only see the "‚ù§Ô∏è" button, making the interface cleaner and more appropriate for the mutual like situation.
