koshkidadanet: В таблице `telegram_users` у меня есть полу `telegram_id`. Безопасно ли распространять этот id? 

GitHub Copilot: It’s generally best to avoid publicly exposing a user’s Telegram ID. While it’s not as sensitive as a token or password, it can still be used to identify and message the user, so treat it with the same care you would any unique personal identifier.

koshkidadanet: Currently, user profiles are displayed in two messages: profile media files and profile description. I want the rank of a profile for a specific user to be displayed alongside the media files in the message. For example, when I select the "Смотерть анкеты" action, the first profile displayed should have the text `/1` added to its media files, and the second should have `/2`.

Additionally, this text should act as a command. When I click `/1`, the profile of the user ranked first should be displayed again.

**Requirements:**
1. If a user updates their profile, the ranking should also update, meaning that the `/1` command may now refer to a different profile.
2. If a user scrolls through several profiles, enters the `/1` command, and then clicks "Далее" the next profile should be displayed starting from where they left off. For example, if they stopped at the 10th profile, the 11th profile should be displayed after skipping the first one.

GitHub Copilot: I'll help you modify the code to implement this functionality. Here's the step-by-step solution:

1. Update the send_profile_media function to include rank information
2. Add a command handler for rank-based profile viewing
3. Ensure viewing state is preserved when using rank commands

### [aiogram_bot.py](file:///home/koshkidadanet/My%20Files/connect-bot/src/aiogram_bot.py)

Main changes to handle rank commands and profile display:



This implementation:

1. Adds rank numbers to media captions (e.g., "/1", "/2", etc.)
2. Maintains viewing state when using rank commands
3. Updates rankings when profiles are modified
4. Shows rank commands in media captions instead of profile text
5. Allows users to jump to specific ranks while preserving their current position in the viewing sequence

The rank commands work by:
1. Capturing any message that starts with "/" followed by digits
2. Converting the rank to a zero-based index
3. Looking up the profile at that rank in the user's ranked profiles
4. Displaying the profile while maintaining the current viewing state

When a user updates their profile:
1. The ranking is updated (this was already implemented in the existing code)
2. Rank commands will now point to potentially different profiles based on the new rankings
3. The viewing sequence continues from where they left off after using a rank command

Made changes.

koshkidadanet: Alright, now let's make it so that the user can use the `/n` command only if they have already viewed the `/n` profile. For example, if the user has viewed only one profile and enters the `/5` command, it should not work. Instead, a message like "Вы еще не долистали до анкеты под номером 5!" can be displayed.

GitHub Copilot: I'll help you modify the code to implement this functionality. We need to track the maximum viewed profile index and check it before allowing access to ranked profiles.

### [aiogram_bot.py](file:///home/koshkidadanet/My%20Files/connect-bot/src/aiogram_bot.py)

Add a new message and modify the rank command handler:



The changes:

1. Added a new message 'profile_not_viewed' to MESSAGES dictionary
2. Added tracking of max_viewed_index in view_next_profile function
3. Modified handle_rank_command to check max_viewed_index before showing a profile
4. Made sure max_viewed_index persists in state data

Now users can only use /n commands for profiles they have already seen by scrolling through them with the "Далее" button.

Made changes.

koshkidadanet: When the `data_science.py` script is executed, additional folders appear in the `chroma_db` directory. 

For example, before execution, the following folders were present:  
`8fdc5a4-3fd2-4d8d-b2dd-c9b9d7882e8a`  
`237cc347-9288-41fd-9900-1cc9d5cabab9`  

After execution, the folders look like this:  
`08fdc5a4-3fd2-4d8d-b2dd-c9b9d7882e8a`  
`237cc347-9288-41fd-9900-1cc9d5cabab9`  
`5ad14f48-adb6-44e5-b591-2ca25d837764`  
`6ab80890-9d5e-4d25-b834-aec886e18173`  

I understand that these are new vector storages being created. I do not want new ones to be created; I want the existing ones to be modified instead.  

If I’m mistaken, please explain the issue and suggest a solution.

GitHub Copilot: The issue is with the initialization of the ChromaDB client and collections. When you call `reset_collections()`, it's deleting and recreating collections, which can result in new storage folders being created.

Let's modify the `data_science.py` file to properly handle existing collections and prevent unnecessary folder creation:

### [data_science.py](file:///home/koshkidadanet/My%20Files/connect-bot/src/data_science.py)

Updates to ensure persistent storage and proper collection management:



Key changes made:

1. Modified `__init__` to use `get_collection` first and only create if it doesn't exist
2. Added proper persistence settings to ChromaDB client initialization
3. Rewrote `sync_with_database` to:
   - Keep existing vectors
   - Only update changed or new users
   - Remove vectors for deleted users
4. Removed the `reset_collections` method call from sync process

This should now:
1. Use existing collections instead of creating new ones
2. Prevent creation of new storage folders
3. Properly persist and update data
4. Clean up only when necessary

The multiple folders you're seeing are likely from previous instances where collections were recreated. You can safely delete the ChromaDB directory and let it be recreated once - after that, it should maintain a single set of persistent collections.

Made changes.

koshkidadanet: 

GitHub Copilot: The error occurs because we're trying to get collections that don't exist yet. Let's modify the initialization to handle this case properly.

### [data_science.py](file:///home/koshkidadanet/My%20Files/connect-bot/src/data_science.py)



The main changes are:
1. Using `get_or_create_collection` instead of trying to get then create
2. Added more informative print statements for debugging
3. Made the `reset_collections` method more robust with error handling

This should now work whether the collections exist or not. The collections will be created on first run and reused on subsequent runs.

Made changes.

koshkidadanet: If a user attaches a file of an unsupported format, such as a .txt file, while creating their profile at the media attachment stage, an error will appear in the logs. If the user attaches an unsupported file multiple times, their profile will be duplicated multiple times when viewed by other users. I believe we need a mechanism to detect files of unsupported formats.

Error message:


GitHub Copilot: The issue occurs because we're not properly handling unsupported file types during the media upload stage. Let's modify the code to handle this case properly.

### [aiogram_bot.py](file:///home/koshkidadanet/My%20Files/connect-bot/src/aiogram_bot.py)



The changes made:

1. Added a new message for unsupported media types
2. Added checks for unsupported media types in both `handle_media_upload` and `process_media`
3. Added `db.refresh(user)` after creating a new user to ensure we have the correct ID
4. Improved the media handling logic to prevent processing unsupported file types

These changes will:
1. Prevent the processing of unsupported file types
2. Show a friendly message to the user when they try to upload an unsupported file
3. Prevent profile duplication issues by properly handling the user creation process
4. Prevent the foreign key violation error by ensuring the user ID is properly set

The error you were seeing was caused by trying to create rankings for a user that wasn't properly saved in the database. The new checks and proper database refresh should prevent this issue.

Made changes.

koshkidadanet: Let's introduce restrictions on the size of attached media files. For example, photos can be limited to 3 MB, and videos to either 30 MB or 15 seconds.

GitHub Copilot: I'll help you implement media file size restrictions. Here's the solution:

### [aiogram_bot.py](file:///home/koshkidadanet/My%20Files/connect-bot/src/aiogram_bot.py)

Add new messages and update the media handling functions to check file sizes and video duration:



The changes:
1. Added new error messages for oversized media
2. Added constants for media size restrictions
3. Added size checks in handle_photo_upload
4. Added size and duration checks in handle_video_upload

Now the bot will:
1. Reject photos larger than 3 MB
2. Reject videos larger than 30 MB
3. Reject videos longer than 15 seconds
4. Show appropriate error messages to guide users

Users will need to compress their media files if they exceed these limits.

Made changes.

koshkidadanet: Let's add the `/start` command, which will display a welcome message to the user with the following instructions:  
1. To begin, you need to enter the `/profile` command.  
2. The system will match profiles that fit your description of the conversation partner.  
3. You can return to skipped profiles, for example, by using the `/1` command.  

The welcome message should be cute and include emojis, such as a blue heart.

GitHub Copilot: I'll help you add the `/start` command with a friendly welcome message. Here's the solution:

### [aiogram_bot.py](file:///home/koshkidadanet/My%20Files/connect-bot/src/aiogram_bot.py)



The changes:
1. Added a new welcome message with emojis and clear instructions
2. Added the /start command to the bot's command list
3. Created a command handler for /start that displays the welcome message
4. Removed any existing keyboard when showing the welcome message

The welcome message is friendly and informative, using emojis to make it more engaging and easier to read. The instructions are clear and numbered, making it easy for users to understand how to get started.

Made changes.

koshkidadanet: Make it so that a "Моя анкета" button appears below the welcome message, which also executes the `/profile` command. Also, let's remove the `/start` command from the menu.

GitHub Copilot: I'll help you modify the code to add the button and update the commands menu.

### [aiogram_bot.py](file:///home/koshkidadanet/My%20Files/connect-bot/src/aiogram_bot.py)



The changes:
1. Added `get_start_keyboard()` function to create the keyboard with "Моя анкета" button
2. Modified `set_commands()` to remove the /start command from the menu
3. Updated `cmd_start()` to show the keyboard with the "Моя анкета" button

Since we already have a handler for "Моя анкета" button text, it will automatically work with the button from the welcome message.

Made changes.

koshkidadanet: Let's restrict the `handle_photo_upload` function call if the user has already reached the limit of 3 photos.

GitHub Copilot: Let's modify the photo handling logic to prevent unnecessary processing when the limit is reached.

### [aiogram_bot.py](file:///home/koshkidadanet/My%20Files/connect-bot/src/aiogram_bot.py)



Changes made:
1. Added new message for when photo limit is reached
2. Moved photo count check to the beginning of the function
3. Simplified the photos_left calculation
4. Added early return with message when limit is reached

This change will prevent unnecessary size checks and database operations when the user has already reached the photo limit.

Made changes.

koshkidadanet: Is it possible to ensure that once the `handle_photo_upload` function returns `True` for the first time, it will no longer be called during the current session of editing media files for the profile? For example, if a user attaches 10 images, the function `handle_photo_upload` would return `True` on the 3rd image (indicating the user has reached the limit). After that, the function should no longer be invoked since the upload limit has already been reached.

Currently, if the user attaches 10 images, the bot generates the following sequence of messages:  
- "Фото добавлено! Вы можете добавить ещё 2 фото или нажать 'Моя анкета' для завершения."  
- "Достигнут лимит фотографий."  
- "**Медиафайлы анкеты пользователя**"  
- "Достигнут лимит фотографий.."  
- "Достигнут лимит фотографий."  
- "Достигнут лимит фотографий."  
- "Фото добавлено! Вы можете добавить ещё 1 фото или нажать 'Моя анкета' для завершения."  
- "**Текст профиля пользователя**"  
- "**Список действий**"  

As a result, after the first three images are processed, the user's profile media files are displayed, followed by messages for the remaining uploads. Only after that are the profile text and the action list shown. This disrupts the expected output, as the profile appears split between media files and text, which should be presented together.

I would like the `handle_photo_upload` function to stop being called once it returns `True` for the first time during the current session. This will prevent the issue, ensuring that after processing the first three images, the complete profile is displayed without messages for subsequent uploads.

Alternatively, there’s another potential solution: process all the media files the user attaches first, and only then display the complete profile. This would ensure the profile media files are shown together with the profile description and the list of actions.

Please implement the simplest and most effective solution to address this issue.

GitHub Copilot: Let's implement the first solution - preventing `handle_photo_upload` from being called after it returns `True`. We'll use the FSM state data to track this.

### [aiogram_bot.py](file:///home/koshkidadanet/My%20Files/connect-bot/src/aiogram_bot.py)



Changes made:

1. Added a `photo_limit_reached` flag in the state data
2. Modified `handle_media_upload` to:
   - Check the flag before processing photos
   - Set the flag when limit is reached
   - Return early if the limit was already reached
3. Modified `cmd_profile` to reset the flag when starting a new media upload session

This solution:
1. Prevents redundant processing of photos after the limit is reached
2. Shows the complete profile only once, when the limit is reached
3. Maintains clean message flow in the chat
4. Resets properly when starting a new profile or editing

The second solution you mentioned would be more complex and require buffering media files, which could lead to race conditions. This solution is simpler and more effective.

Made changes.

koshkidadanet: Currently, when a user reaches the limit of 3 photos while attaching media files, their profile is automatically displayed. Let's not do this. Instead, let the user manually press the "Моя анкета" button.

GitHub Copilot: Let's modify the code to let users control when they want to finish their profile. Here are the changes:

### [aiogram_bot.py](file:///home/koshkidadanet/My%20Files/connect-bot/src/aiogram_bot.py)



The changes:
1. Removed automatic profile display when photo limit is reached
2. Added keyboard with "Моя анкета" button to the photo limit message
3. Kept state active so user can press "Моя анкета" when they're ready
4. Still track photo_limit_reached in state to prevent further uploads

This gives users more control over when they want to finish their profile setup, while still enforcing the 3-photo limit.

Made changes.

koshkidadanet: Currently, when a user attaches a video, the checks for size are performed first, displaying messages such as `video_too_large` or `video_too_long`. Let's prioritize checking whether the user has started attaching a photo, i.e., `video_photo_conflict`.

GitHub Copilot: I'll help modify the video upload handler to check for existing photos first.

### [aiogram_bot.py](file:///home/koshkidadanet/My%20Files/connect-bot/src/aiogram_bot.py)



Changes made:
1. Moved the photo conflict check to the top
2. Reordered the validation checks for better user experience
3. Kept the actual media handling logic the same

Now users will immediately know if they can't add a video due to existing photos, before any size or duration checks are performed.

Made changes.

koshkidadanet: Let's display the message "Фото добавлено! Нажмите 'Моя анкета' для завершения." to the user when they attach 3 photos.

GitHub Copilot: I'll help modify the code to show the new message when the photo limit is reached.

### [aiogram_bot.py](file:///home/koshkidadanet/My%20Files/connect-bot/src/aiogram_bot.py)



Changes made:
1. Added new message 'photos_done' to MESSAGES dictionary
2. Modified handle_photo_upload to show the new message when the third photo is added
3. Kept the same keyboard with "Моя анкета" button

Now when users add their third photo, they'll see a clear message telling them to press "Моя анкета" to complete their profile.

Made changes.
