koshkidadanet: В таблице `telegram_users` у меня есть полу `telegram_id`. Безопасно ли распространять этот id? 

GitHub Copilot: It’s generally best to avoid publicly exposing a user’s Telegram ID. While it’s not as sensitive as a token or password, it can still be used to identify and message the user, so treat it with the same care you would any unique personal identifier.

koshkidadanet: Currently, user profiles are displayed in two messages: profile media files and profile description. I want the rank of a profile for a specific user to be displayed alongside the media files in the message. For example, when I select the "Смотерть анкеты" action, the first profile displayed should have the text `/1` added to its media files, and the second should have `/2`.

Additionally, this text should act as a command. When I click `/1`, the profile of the user ranked first should be displayed again.

**Requirements:**
1. If a user updates their profile, the ranking should also update, meaning that the `/1` command may now refer to a different profile.
2. If a user scrolls through several profiles, enters the `/1` command, and then clicks "Далее" the next profile should be displayed starting from where they left off. For example, if they stopped at the 10th profile, the 11th profile should be displayed after skipping the first one.

GitHub Copilot: I'll help you modify the code to implement this functionality. Here's the step-by-step solution:

1. Update the send_profile_media function to include rank information
2. Add a command handler for rank-based profile viewing
3. Ensure viewing state is preserved when using rank commands

### [aiogram_bot.py](file:///home/koshkidadanet/My%20Files/connect-bot/src/aiogram_bot.py)

Main changes to handle rank commands and profile display:



This implementation:

1. Adds rank numbers to media captions (e.g., "/1", "/2", etc.)
2. Maintains viewing state when using rank commands
3. Updates rankings when profiles are modified
4. Shows rank commands in media captions instead of profile text
5. Allows users to jump to specific ranks while preserving their current position in the viewing sequence

The rank commands work by:
1. Capturing any message that starts with "/" followed by digits
2. Converting the rank to a zero-based index
3. Looking up the profile at that rank in the user's ranked profiles
4. Displaying the profile while maintaining the current viewing state

When a user updates their profile:
1. The ranking is updated (this was already implemented in the existing code)
2. Rank commands will now point to potentially different profiles based on the new rankings
3. The viewing sequence continues from where they left off after using a rank command

Made changes.

koshkidadanet: Alright, now let's make it so that the user can use the `/n` command only if they have already viewed the `/n` profile. For example, if the user has viewed only one profile and enters the `/5` command, it should not work. Instead, a message like "Вы еще не долистали до анкеты под номером 5!" can be displayed.

GitHub Copilot: I'll help you modify the code to implement this functionality. We need to track the maximum viewed profile index and check it before allowing access to ranked profiles.

### [aiogram_bot.py](file:///home/koshkidadanet/My%20Files/connect-bot/src/aiogram_bot.py)

Add a new message and modify the rank command handler:



The changes:

1. Added a new message 'profile_not_viewed' to MESSAGES dictionary
2. Added tracking of max_viewed_index in view_next_profile function
3. Modified handle_rank_command to check max_viewed_index before showing a profile
4. Made sure max_viewed_index persists in state data

Now users can only use /n commands for profiles they have already seen by scrolling through them with the "Далее" button.

Made changes.
